# DancingLinks
Implementation of the dancing links by Prof. Knuth. This is the current implementation of the dancing links as stated in the draft of the book "pre-fascicle 5c (“Dancing Links”)" in 2019
DLX1.hs in the  implementation using iterations ( WhileM loops )
dld3.hs relies on recursions to replace the use of iterations 
dld4.hs same as dld3.hs but reduces the number of access to memory by the algorithm
