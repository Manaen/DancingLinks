# DancingLinks
Implementation of the dancing links by Prof. Knuth. This is the current implementation of the dancing links as stated in the draft of the book "pre-fascicle 5c (“Dancing Links”)" in 2019  
DLX1.hs in the  implementation using iterations ( WhileM loops )  
dld3.hs relies on recursions to replace the use of iterations   
dld4.hs same as dld3.hs but reduces the number of access to memory by the algorithm  
  
how to run the program:  
when you run main, you are asked to input the file adress containing the test data, and voila! after the program finishes it prints the number of found solutions into a file named Output.txt
